        <title>Parser: Some grammar ambiguities may go undetected</title>
        <text>When the last element of an alternative is optional, 
        some ambiguities may go undetected. This is due to not 
        properly comparing the tokens in the optional element with 
        the tokens after the production. The ambiguious grammar 
        <code>A = B ["x"];  B = "y" ["x"];</code> illustrates this.
        In some cases this may also lead to parse errors as ambiguities
        have not been resolved with the appropriate number of look-ahead
        tokens. This error is present in all versions of Grammatica,
        but occurs infrequently. (Bug #4117)</text>

        <title>Regular Expressions: Not fully JDK 1.4 compatible</title>
        <text>The regular expression library is still lacking in some
        ways compared to the implementation in JDK 1.4 (or Perl 5). 
        The library should be extended to support as many constructs 
        as possible. (Bug #3597)</text>

        <title>Grammar: Add support for modular grammars</title>
        <text>By allowing one grammar to reference another, it 
        would be possible to create more complex modular parsers.
        This feature also requires support for modular tokenizers
        and parses, as well as the generation of modular code.

        <title>Grammar: Add localization support</title>
        <text>This includes finding an architecture that works for 
        grammar files, making it possible to localize the error 
        messages without rewriting the grammar file. This 
        architecture must support different methods depending on 
        generated source (ResourceBundles in Java, Gnu Gettext in C 
        &amp; C++). (Bug #3600)</text>

        <title>Grammar: Production representation should be improved</title>
        <text>The internal representation of a production makes it 
        hard for several alternatives to share a several left-hand
        side elements. This may cause inherent ambiguities to be
        found, as the number of look-ahead tokens needed to separate
        the alternatives is infinite. If these alternatives could 
        share the first elements, this ambiguity would not require
        a rewrite of the grammar. (Bug #4322)</text>
      </item>

        <title>Grammar: Identical productions should be unified</title>
        <text>Identical syntetic productions are not indentified as 
        such. Instead, a new syntetic production is added in each 
        case. This will cause problems for LR parsers, and is 
        generally inefficient. Identical syntetic productions should 
        be unified. (Bug #3602)</text>

        <title>Tokenizer: Improve processing speed</title>
        <text>There are probably still substantial parsing speed 
        improvements to gain by improving the tokenizer performance. 
        All the obvious optimizations have already been done, however. 
        The next step is probably to create a DFA. (Bug #3603)</text>
      </item>

      <item>
        <title>Tokenizer: Add support for modes</title>
        <text>When reading certain tokens the tokenizer should be 
        able to enter some kind of "mode", limiting the set of tokens
        that are considered for a match. This is highly useful in 
        some grammars, where the token syntax isn't easily 
        represented with regular expressions. (Bug #3604)</text>
      </item>

      <item>
        <title>Parser: Add support for LR grammars</title>
        <text>This probably means writing at least an LALR(1) parser, 
        and probably also some kind of LR(k) parser. (Bug #3606)</text>
      </item>

      <item>
        <title>Parser: Add parsing through code callbacks</title>
        <text>This would allow more complex grammars to be parsed 
        where some productions cannot be expressed in EBNF. Instead a
        callback method would be called to parse some specific 
        productions. (Bug #3607)</text>
      </item>
    
      <item>
        <title>Parser: Support parsing several files with one instance</title>
        <text>A single parser instance should be possible to use for 
        parsing several files, something not allowed by the current 
        API. The current solution is ineffective when parsing multiple
        files through the same parser, as the look-ahead token sets 
        must be calculated again every time a new file is parsed.

        <title>Analyzer: Allow node values propagating downwards</title>
        <text>Improve the analyzer framework to handle node values 
        propagating downwards or sideways in the tree as well.

        <title>Code Generation: Support creation of a C parser</title>
        <text>This requires the writing of a C runtime library plus 
        appropriate code generation classes. (Bug #3609)</text>
      </item>
  
      <item>
        <title>Code Generation: Support creation of a C++ parser</title>
        <text>This requires the writing of a C++ runtime library plus 
        appropriate code generation classes. (Bug #3610)</text>
      </item>
      
      <item>
        <title>Error Handling: Add file reference in errors</title>
        <text>The exceptions could be extended with a file location
        object (a file reference) to simplify the error handling 
        when several files are parsed. (Bug #4180)</text>
